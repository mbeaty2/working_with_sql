# Working with SQL

## Description

This repository contains a growing list of intermediate and advanced SQL examples, acting as a portfolio showcasing my SQL knowledge and experience. These examples range from exploring international debt statistics and business revenue to when was the golden age of video games and everything in between. Within each folder contains the datasets and a jupyter notebook exploring and answering questions related to the datasets using SQL techniques. A few of these were built from DataCamp's project database, while others were built from open-source datasets. All include my own work and expertise in SQL. 

## Getting Started

### Notes for Viewing and Building from this Repository 

* These notebooks are set-up to run as is as examples of my SQL knowledge base.
* Running this code can be done with any code editor tool, but be sure to have access to the datasets prior to doing so. 

## Help

I would encourage anytone struggling to repeat these projects or understand the process of these projects to review intermediate and advanced SQL techniques. My personal favourite free resources include:
